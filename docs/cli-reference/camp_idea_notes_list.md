## camp idea notes list

List notes across folders

### Synopsis

List notes in the note store, newest first by creation time.

Notes in the notes root and every folder, including meetings, are listed.
Archived notes are listed only with --folder archived. --folder matches one
folder exactly, without its subfolders; use "." for the notes root.

"camp idea list --status notes" returns the same notes.
