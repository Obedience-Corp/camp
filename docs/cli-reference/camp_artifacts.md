## camp artifacts

Explore artifact files and manage declared roots

### Synopsis

Open the artifact explorer: search files, open them with Enter, copy paths
with y, or go to their folder with g (requires camp shell-init).
The explorer lists files outside git in declared roots, including ignored
files. Tracked files are excluded. --plain and --json work without a terminal.

Manage the camp's declared artifact roots: directories of heavy non-git
payloads (media, renders, datasets) that 'camp sync --from <machine>' moves
between your machines with rsync instead of git.

The declaration file (.campaign/artifacts.yaml) is committed, so every
machine knows what belongs to the camp. Declared roots should be
gitignored: a root that is also git-tracked would make the same bytes both
git content and artifact content. Manifests and per-peer sync snapshots are
machine-local derived state under .campaign/cache (gitignored).
